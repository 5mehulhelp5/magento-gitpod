# magento-gitpod

This repository is an example configuration for setting up Magento 2 as a development envrionment on Gitpod.

### Road Map
- [x] Run Magento fully installed on load
- [x] Have no files marked as changed in GIT.
- [x] Install Magento SQL once on first load, delete flag to reinstall
- [x] Import staging SQL file replacing urls 
- [ ] Improve config to simplify configuring the build components
- [ ] Magento 2.4.4 and PHP8.1 support
- [ ] Add additional SQL and config updates, Magento config for SMTP details, Algolia indexing etc.
